/**
 * # Hilt: Dependency Injection Simplified
 * Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies manual dependency injection in your project.
 * It is built on top of the popular DI framework Dagger and provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection
 * into an Android application in a simpler and more cohesive way.
 *
 * ## Key Concepts of Hilt
 *
 * - **Automatic Component Management**: Hilt manages components' lifecycles automatically. It creates, stores,
 *   and provides dependencies automatically at the correct time in the lifecycle of an Android app.
 *
 * - **Simplified Configuration**: Hilt uses predefined components that match Android's lifecycle
 *   (such as Application, Activity, Fragment, View, Service, etc.), which significantly reduces the setup
 *   and configuration effort that Dagger usually requires.
 *
 * - **Compile-time Validation**: Like Dagger, Hilt performs most of its analysis at compile-time, ensuring
 *   that dependency injection errors are caught early in the development process, which reduces runtime issues
 *   and crashes due to misconfigured dependencies.
 *
 * - **Standardized Components**: Hilt defines standard components and scopes aligned with Android lifecycles,
 *   reducing the chances of making mistakes related to the lifecycle and scope of the provided dependencies.
 *
 * ## How Hilt Works
 *
 * To understand how Hilt works, itâ€™s essential to look at its main components:
 *
 * - **@HiltAndroidApp**: Placed on the Application class, this annotation initializes Hilt's code generation,
 *   including a base class for your application that can serve dependencies.
 *
 * - **@AndroidEntryPoint**: This annotation can be added to Android classes like activities, fragments, views, etc.
 *   It makes Dagger generate a corresponding Hilt component under the hood for each class, allowing these classes
 *   to receive dependencies.
 *
 * - **@Inject**: Used to request dependencies. It can be placed on constructor, field, or method in Android
 *   classes annotated with `@AndroidEntryPoint`.
 *
 * - **Modules and Installer Modules**: Regular Dagger modules are used to define how to provide instances of
 *   different types. Hilt modules are abstract classes annotated with `@Module`. Additionally, `@InstallIn`
 *   is used to specify which Hilt component(s) the module will provide bindings for.
 *
 * - **Component Scopes**: Hilt utilizes predefined scopes like `@Singleton`, `@ActivityRetainedScoped`,
 *   `@ActivityScoped`, etc., to control the lifespan of dependencies.
 *
 * ## The Flow of Dependency Injection with Hilt
 *
 * 1. **Initialization**: When an Android application starts, the `@HiltAndroidApp` annotated application
 *    class triggers the generation of the DI graph, preparing all singleton scoped dependencies.
 *
 * 2. **Injection into Entry Points**: For each Android class annotated with `@AndroidEntryPoint`, Hilt
 *    automatically generates a subcomponent that can inject the required dependencies according to the annotations
 *    like `@Inject`.
 *
 * 3. **Provision and Usage**: During the component's (like an Activity or Fragment) lifecycle, the required
 *    dependencies are provided by Hilt's managed components. This is typically done without the user having
 *    to manually control the creation or lifecycle of these objects.
 *
 * 4. **Scope Management**: As Android components are created and destroyed, Hilt manages scoped dependencies
 *    (like those scoped to an Activity) ensuring they're only available while the component exists.
 *
 * ## Benefits of Using Hilt
 *
 * - **Reduced Boilerplate**: Automatically handles component lifecycles and generation.
 * - **Improved Readability**: By standardizing how components are injected, the codebase becomes easier to understand.
 * - **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to manage and update dependencies in a large team or on large projects.
 * - **Robustness**: Compile-time validations reduce runtime errors significantly.
 *
 * By abstracting much of the complexity of setting up Dagger, Hilt makes dependency injection easier to implement correctly
 * and reduces the likelihood of common mistakes related to Dagger's manual setup and configuration.
