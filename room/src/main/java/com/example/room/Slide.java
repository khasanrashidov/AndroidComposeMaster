/**
 * ROOM is a persistence library, part of Android Jetpack, that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
 * It simplifies database operations and ensures that you're using best practices for accessing the database on a device.
 *
 * Key components of ROOM are:
 * - Database: Contains the database holder and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app's persisted data.
 * - Entity: Represents a table within the database.
 * - DAO (Data Access Object): Contains the methods used for accessing the database.
 *
 * ROOM provides compile-time checks of SQLite statements and can return RxJava, Flowable and LiveData observables.
 * It also supports coroutines and makes it easier to perform database operations on the background thread.
